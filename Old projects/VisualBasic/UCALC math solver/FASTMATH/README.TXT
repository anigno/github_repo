UCalc Fast Math Parser 2.0.
Copyright © 1998-1999 by Daniel Corbier.
All rights reserved.

UCalc Fast Math Parser is a 32-bit DLL component which allows programs
to evaluate math expressions that are defined at run time.  It includes
a one step ucEval function for simplicity, as well as a very fast
ucEvaluate function, designed for use in loops which repeat the same
operation with different values.  This component supports conventional
math operators and functions, as well as user variables and functions,
and strings, and it is suitable for heavy duty number crunching.  This
version includes direct support for Visual Basic, C++ (Microsoft and
Borland), PowerBASIC (PB/DLL and PB/CC), and Delphi.  Requires Win95
or above.

New features since version 1.0 include:

* Direct support for C++, Delphi, and PowerBASIC (in addition to VB).

* Increased speed.

* Unlimited number of user functions, variables, and concurrent
  expressions, and unlimited definition space.

* No bulky system files to distribute.  UCALC32.DLL, which is slim
  in size, is the only file from this component which needs to
  accompany your program.

* Callbacks to functions in your source code are supported.

* String support.

* Expression, variable, and string argument types.  This opens up the
  door to an entirely new category of functions which can be defined.

* Function arguments can be defined as optional.

* User operators can now be defined.

* Variables and functions can now be undefined.

* International consideration for decimal and argument separators.

* Syntax can be customized with ucPreParse.

* ucErrorMessage has more specific messages.  Also, user error messages
  can be defined.  The parser captures errors such as Division by 0,
  instead of leaving it to the host compiler.  Additional error
  information (such as the list of undefined variables) is provided by
  ucErrorData.

* Calculations are done using the more precise extended precision numbers
  (long double) instead of double precision.

* New functions, and a new operator include: min, max, IIf, and \ .

* Built-in function names can be changed with ucAlias.

* Floating point numbers in hexadecimal, binary, and octal notations are
  supported.

* The underscore character "_" is now acceptable in user defined names.

* Relational operators can be set to return a -1 instead of 1.
