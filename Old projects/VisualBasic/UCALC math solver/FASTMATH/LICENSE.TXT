LICENSE AGREEMENT


Continued usage of this component for purposes other then testing the
parser requires a license.  License options include Free, Upgrade,
Lite, Educational, Standard, and Professional.  Before selecting a
license option, please read the entire license document.

STANDARD LICENSE.  Under this license, the licensee receives a special
serial number which, when applied, causes the opening message boxes
not to appear.  All features can be used, except for function call-
backs (user functions that are defined with the address of a function
in the programmer's source code), and preparsing (with ucPreParse).

PROFESSIONAL LICENSE.  The licensee receives a serial number as
described above.  Under this license, all features are made available.

LITE LICENSE.  The licensee receives a serial number as described above.
Under this license, the licensee is limited to 5 user variables.
Preparsing (with ucPreParse), and user functions are not available.

FREE LICENSE.  With this option, the licensee is allowed to use the
component for personal projects, such as homework assignments, school
science projects, and such.  It covers software development with the
component only on personally-owned computers, such has a home PC.
This license does not cover usage of the component on school computers,
with the exception of special demonstrations.  For instance a
teacher may demonstrate the component as part of a lecture.  However,
permanent installation of the software on school computers for continued
use requires an Educational License.  The licensee of the free option
receives code which suppresses the second opening message box.  This
license supports the use of all features.

The free license is dispensed upon request, either by filling out the user
satisfaction survey at http://www.ucalc.com/mathparser/dllquest.html, or
by e-mailing the request to license@ucalc.com.  The free license is not
available through resellers, and cannot be transferred to a third party.
The free license is dispensed at the sole discretion of the licensor, and
conditions for the free license are subject to change.
See http://www.ucalc.com/bulletin.html in case there are any changes.

EDUCATIONAL LICENSE.  The licensee gets all the benefits of a professional
license, but at the low cost of the Limited License.  This license is for
non-commercial use within an educational institution.

UPGRADE LICENSE.  The licensee can upgrade from either the standard or
developer license of version 1.0 to the Professional License, or from
Limited to Standard, or Standard to Professional, for the same minimum
price.


With the exception of the Free and Educational licenses, the DLL can be
included royalty-free in commercially distributed projects as well as
non-commercial projects.


The following part of this document serves as a license agreement between
the author of UCalc Fast Math Parser, and you (as an individual or single
entity software developer using this component), pertaining to version 2.0
of the UCalc Fast Math Parser component.  Your usage of this component
implies your acceptance to abide by the terms of this end user license
agreement.

1. GRANT OF LICENSE.  Daniel Corbier, author of UCalc Fast Math Parser,
grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and
use the software on your computer.  This license is conditional, based
on the following limitations:  (i) You may not reverse engineer, decompile,
disassemble, or otherwise attempt to modify the component.  (ii)  If you
have not obtained a license, then you may not remove, suppress, hide, or
cause your program to skip the opening message box(es).  (iii) You may not
use the trial copy for purposes other than evaluation of the component,
or beta testing of your own product.  (iii) If you have purchased a
license, you may not use this component for software development on more
computers than licensed for.

2a. DISTRIBUTION OF TRIAL EDITION.  The trial edition may be distributed
under these conditions:  (i) All parts of the component (including
documentation and sample project files) must be distributed together.
(ii) The component and associated files may be distributed as a unit on
legitimate software distribution sites.  (iii) The trial edition may not
be distributed as part of another program which uses it.

2b. DISTRIBUTION OF LICENSED VERSION.  Only the .DLL file from the parser
component may be distributed as part of your finished program.  As many
copies of the DLL as necessary can be distributed royalty-free.  Add-on
libraries for this component may also be distributed royalty-free as long
as the serial number is not distributed or implemented in the library.
However, under the license options available in this documentation, the
component itself should not be distributed as part of another programming
component or programming language, or tool for programmers.  To negotiate
other possible licensing options, send e-mail to license@ucalc.com.

3. LIMITED WARRANTY.  This component is provided on an "as is" basis
without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied, including, but not
limited to implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a
particular purpose.  All other warranties are also expressly disclaimed.

4. SUITABILITY.  The persons or companies using this component are solely
responsible for thoroughly testing it to make sure it works to their
satisfaction before purchasing a license and incorporating a non-
evaluation version into their programs.  All features are made available
for full testing purposes in the evaluation copy.  The DLL that is used
in the demo is the same one that is used as the licensed copy.  Therefore,
by obtaining a license, the licensee indicates that the program has met
his/her expectations and runs to his/her satisfaction.

5. EXPORT. You agree to comply with U.S. export laws and regulations
concerning the acquisition, usage or transfer of computer software.
