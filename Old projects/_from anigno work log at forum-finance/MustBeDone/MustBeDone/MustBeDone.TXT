The wizard has built 2 cab(s) for your application. The cabs are in 'C:\My Documents\Visual Vb Vc.LIB\VbProjects\MustBeDone\Package'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (C:\My Documents\Visual Vb Vc.LIB\VbProjects\MustBeDone\Package\Support\MustBeDone.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab files in case you make changes to some of the files.
