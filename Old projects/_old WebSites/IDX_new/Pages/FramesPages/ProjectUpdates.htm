		Overturned (Capsized) Barge Mapping Project<br>
		<br>
		<u>Overview</u><br>
		The Capsized Barge lies completely upside down in 42m of water approx. 4 
		Km West South West of the Ashdod Marina in Israel.<br>
		<br>
		This wreck has been measured to be 47m long, lying with it bow pointing 
		SSE. It has multiple openings along its hull (now facing up) allowing 
		for penetration, and is completely empty inside.<br>
		<br>
		The wreck lies in a field of debris among large boulders over 6-8 meters 
		high. It is about 5 meters in height and still has two anchors attached 
		to its bow. Parts of the barge's machinery are visible in the debris 
		field but yet to be identified or positioned. <br>
		<br>
		The location of the barge relative to the boulders surrounding it is not 
		yet determined.<br>
		<br>
		The project goals are to map and document the boulder and debris field 
		in which the barge lies, locate any major parts of the wreck's hull or 
		machinery, and provide quality images and video of the site.<br>
		<br>
		<u>Updates</u><br>
		January 2nd 2007 - Updated photos here. <br>
		<br>
		First two dives conducted successfully. Team 1 located the barge, tied 
		off and laid two permanent lines heading North and East, to serve as 
		marking points for future survey dives. Team 2 then proceeded to lay 
		non-directional markers every 5 meters on the permanent lines to assist 
		in surveying and ensuring complete coverage of the site.<br>
		<br>
		Visibility was good with a clear 5-6m on the bottom, with not much light 
		due to a murky plankton layer at approx. 20m depth. Bottom temperature 
		was 18c</td>
