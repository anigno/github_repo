!Options  - The Option Pricing Add-In for Excel for Windows
Version  2.2 - by Ray Steele

********************************************************
The file README22.XLS has the same (and more) information in an Excel document.

If you do not have Excel 5.0 or higher, you cannot use the add-in anyway.
